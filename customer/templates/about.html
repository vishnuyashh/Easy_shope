            Myntra - Industry
            As per a report by Mordor Intelligence, the Indian e-commerce market is anticipated to witness substantial expansion, with a valuation of USD 92.95 billion by 2023. The market is expected to grow rapidly, with a projected value of USD 246.10 billion by 2028, according to the analysis.
            
            This represents a remarkable Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 21.50% from 2023 to 2028. This significant development trajectory highlights how e-commerce is becoming more and more prevalent in the Indian industry, fueled by changes in customer tastes, digitization, and technology breakthroughs. <br><br>
            
            <span><b>EASYSHOPE - STARTUP STORY</b></span><br>
            Mukesh Bansal's journey with Myntra began after his time in Silicon Valley. He quit his US employment in 2007 to launch his own company in India. He toured shopping centers frequently to get ideas for creating personalized experiences while investigating both offline and internet sectors.
            
            A visit to an abandoned commercial area in Pune proved to be the turning point. Bansal thought of a better way after observing unsold inventory in physical stores: offering these goods online. This realization resulted in Myntra becoming a platform that revolutionized online shopping by offering shoes, accessories, and apparel in addition to these products.
            
            Mukesh Bansal helped other people with a background in software engineering realize their business goals as a co-founder. Between 2007 and 2010, Myntra concentrated on B2B sales of customizable gift goods that could be ordered on demand. The business gradually changed its emphasis from B2B to individual customer service.
            
            In 2012, Myntra accomplished a noteworthy accomplishment by broadening its product portfolio to encompass 360 Indian and global brands. This was a turning point in Myntra's development into India's largest B2C fashion eCommerce marketplace, capping an incredible journey of success and transformation from a B2B firm.
